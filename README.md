# Flutter Bloc and Clean Architecture Practice

This repository serves as my playground for mastering the Bloc pattern and Clean Architecture in Flutter development. It showcases various implementations of the Bloc library to manage app state reactively while adhering to the principles of Clean Architecture.

## Key Features:

- **Bloc Pattern**: Utilization of the `flutter_bloc` library to handle complex state management in a scalable way.
- **Clean Architecture**: Structured project layout that separates concerns into independent layersâ€”data, domain, and presentation.
- **Dependency Injection**: Usage of `get_it` for managing dependencies, enhancing testability and modularity.
- **Reactive Programming**: Demonstrates the integration of reactive state management with user interfaces in Flutter.
- **Example Implementations**: Contains a login module as a primary example, demonstrating how Bloc interacts with the UI and how data flows within the app.

## Goals:

- To deepen understanding of state management using Bloc in the context of a well-architected Flutter application.
- To explore best practices in implementing Clean Architecture in Flutter, focusing on maintainability and scalability.
- To refine skills in building complex applications with Flutter that are easy to maintain and extend.

This repository is continually evolving as I explore more features and refine my approach to Flutter development using Bloc and Clean Architecture.
